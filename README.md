"Zebra Sense" enhances pedestrian safety at crossings by using smart traffic lights that detect and stop vehicles when children or the elderly cross, and display current weather conditions. It prioritizes emergency vehicles like ambulances by dynamically adjusting traffic signals, creating a safer and more responsive urban environment.
